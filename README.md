Analysis
____________________________________________________________________________________
  This dataset includes school district data which is made up of 15 total schools and 39,170 total students. The total budget   for the district is $246,494,28. Students tend to score and pass at a higher rate for reading (Score: 81.88 and passing at 85.81%) versus math (score: 78.99 and passing at 74.98%). 
  
  With resect to school budget, passing rate for both math and readings scores tend to be decrease with respect to increased spending per student. However, with respect to school size, the passing rate does not appear to be significantly effected until a school is larger than 2000 students. At that threshold, the passing rate declines with respect to the small and medium sized schools. Pass rates by grade for a given school tend to be relatively even. 
  
  There are two different types of schools within the district: Charter (8) and District (7). Charter schoools have significantly higher pass rates with 93.62% passing math, 96.59% of students passing reading and 90.43% of students passing both subjects, compared to 66.55%, 80.80% and 53.67% respectively in District Schools.
  
  While increased budget does not appear to have a direct impact on improving pass rates for students, it is clear     that increased school size does negatively impact the overall passing rates. The school district should look at limiting the maximum size of schools moving forward. If new schools are to be built, to accomodate this change,  Charter schools tend to have a much higher success rate than District schools.
